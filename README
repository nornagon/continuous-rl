How to use GameKit:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nornagon/gamekit my-project
$ cd my-project
$ sbt '~fastOptJS'
```

and write your game in `src/main/scala/game/Main.scala` :)

If GameKit grows a new feature you'd like to use in your game or fixes a bug,
`git merge` from the GameKit repository and resolve any conflicts due to
changes you've made.
