### Continuous Roguelike

Most Roguelikes are discrete in both space (they're played on a grid) and time
(they're turn-based). This is an experiment in building a _continuous_
Roguelike:
- there's no grid, just continuous space.
- there are no turns, but it's not realtime. Monsters don't move unless you do.

There's not much here yet beyond a prototype, but I think this is an
interesting start!
